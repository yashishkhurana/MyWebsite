        <h3>MERN Stack Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code as a distraction from my routine. It was something i always wanted from life. I believe I have gained knowledge and experience in both design and development, and now's the time to give back to the society.</p>

        <h3>Scriptwriting</h3>
        <p>I never thought I would cherish college life so much, but it gave me so much to learn, over the last few months I had seen the best and worst times of my life, but one of the constants in this journey was Team Cinesec. Do watch some of the projects our team worked upon and share your reviews! </p>
